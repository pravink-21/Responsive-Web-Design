          Linux is an extremely popular operating system for hackers. ... First off, Linux's source code is freely available because it is an open source operating system. This means that Linux is very easy to modify or customize. Second, there are countless Linux security distros available that can double as Linux hacking software.

          Nmap is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon. Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses. Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.

      Nmap allows you to scan your network and discover not only everything connected to it, but also a wide variety of information about what's connected, what services each host is operating, and so on. It allows a large number of scanning techniques, such as UDP, TCP connect (), TCP SYN (half-open), and FTP.
